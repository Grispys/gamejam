game where you play as a fruit fly, in the house of some random family. built to scale,
you are super tiny compared to the regular sized rooms. you have to find fruit, garbage, syrups,
stains, decaying aphids, etc. avoid humans, other insects/predators, traps, and manage stamina. you cannot fly forever
and have to regularly land to regain stamina.
